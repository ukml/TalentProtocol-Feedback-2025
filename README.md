# Talent Protocol New Website – Honest Beginner Feedback (Dec 2025)

Hi Talent Protocol team ❤️

I’m a total beginner builder (@ukml) trying to build my Base projects to get Builder Score.

Your new website (talent.app / app.talentprotocol.com) looks amazing, but it’s **very hard** for normal people to understand. Here’s what actually happens:

### Problems real beginners face
- No clear “Add Project” or “Add Experience” button anywhere
- GitHub is connected → but nothing shows in profile
- No “Credentials” tab, no blue button, no “Reputation” section visible
- Quests page exists but doesn’t explain how to add repos
- Support docs are old → talk about buttons that don’t exist anymore

### What beginners want (simple)
1. One big button: **“Add GitHub Project”**
2. After connecting GitHub → automatically show the repos with “Edit” button
3. A 30-second video or 3 screenshots showing exactly where to click

I spent hours clicking everywhere and still couldn’t add my Base repos properly.

Many beginners will just give up and leave.

You are building something important for all of us — please make it simple again 🙏
